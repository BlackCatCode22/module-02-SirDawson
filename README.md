Write the following three programs and submit all source code to this remote repo.

# 1) reverseString.cpp

## Overview

This project is a fun introduction to using strings in C++. You will create a simple program that takes a user's input string and reverses it. For example, if the user inputs "hello", the program will output "olleh".

## Objectives
Learn to manipulate C++ strings.
Understand loops in C++.
Practice getting user input and displaying output.

## Requirements
The program should ask the user to type a word or a sentence.
It should reverse the string entered by the user.
The reversed string should be displayed as output.

## Suggested Implementation Steps
Create a program that prompts the user to enter a string.
Store the user input in a string variable.
Use a loop to reverse the string.
Display the reversed string to the user.

## Tips
Remember that strings in C++ are indexed starting from 0.
A loop can be used to access each character of the string from the end to the beginning.
Test your program with different inputs to make sure it works as expected.

## Extension Ideas
Modify the program to ignore spaces while reversing (e.g., "hello world" becomes "dlrowolleh").
Enhance the program to reverse each word in the sentence individually but keep the word order (e.g., "hello world" becomes "olleh dlrow").

## Submission Guidelines
Submit your source code with comments explaining your logic.
Ensure your code is neatly formatted and easy to read.
Test your program with various inputs to ensure reliability.
